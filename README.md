Competitive programming
=======================

This repository contains everything that can be related with well-known algorithms implementation, competitive programming solutions, and some snippets and cheatsheet to help me.
I'm not an expert, so you'll find without any doubt better implementations elsewhere. Anyway, if you're interested, don't hesitate to take a look.

Currently you'll find my solutions to the Project Euler and a cheatsheet. I'm using either Python 3 or Common Lisp for my implementations.
